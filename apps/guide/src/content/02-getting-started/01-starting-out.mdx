# Starting out

Our [create-discord-bot](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/tree/main/packages/create-discord-bot) command-line interface sets up a basic Discord bot to help you get started on your journey.

## Creating your bot

To use discord.js, you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Deno](https://deno.com), or [Bun](https://bun.sh). discord.js v14 requires Node.js v18.20.4 or higher, but the long-term support (LTS) version is always recommended. For the purposes of this guide, we will be using Node.js.

<Alert title="Tip" type="info">
	To check if you already have Node.js installed, run _`node --version`_ in your terminal. If it outputs _`v18.20.4`_ or
	higher, then you're good to go!
</Alert>

### Windows

- Download from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).
- Use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
- Use [Volta](https://volta.sh).

### macOS

- Download from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
- Use [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node).
- Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating).
- Use [Volta](https://volta.sh).

### Linux

- Visit [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) to determine how you should install Node.js.
- Use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
- Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
- Use [Volta](https://volta.sh).

After installing Node.js, you'll be able to create a new application from your desired package manager. If you're starting out fresh, installing Node.js will also install npm, a package manager for Node.js.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={false} showCopyButton={true}>

```sh npm
npm create discord-bot
```

```sh yarn
yarn create discord-bot
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm create discord-bot
```

```sh bun
bun create discord-bot
```

</CH.Code>

You'll be asked the directory to create the application in, as well as whether TypeScript should be used. Dependencies will automatically be installed for you. After this, you've just got your startup Discord bot template _nearly_ ready!

In the next section, we will explain how to create an application to interact with Discord's API.
